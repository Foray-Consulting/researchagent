Now let's put it all together. Organize all your research and findings into a single, extremely lengthy and overwhelmingly comprehensive report on the topic. Format the report in markdown format. Use a concise but information-rich writing style. Avoid an over-reliance on bullet points and lean into readable, educational paragraphs instead, only using bullet points or numbered points sparingly and when especially useful for readers. It is very important that you cite all your sources using the URLs where the content was derived from. Present the information in an unbiased, fact-based, demonstrable manner that goes into detail to explain the what, why, when, and how of all the concepts discussed. No word limit.
Use a long form paragraphic style with lists or summaries to provide context and references as necessary.
